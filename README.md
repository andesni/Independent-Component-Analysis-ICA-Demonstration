# Independent-Component-Analysis-ICA-Demonstration
This Python script showcases the application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using sklearn.decomposition.FastICA to separate mixed signals into their original independent sources.
The code generates two synthetic signals (sinusoidal and sawtooth), mixes them using a predefined mixing matrix, and then applies ICA to recover the originals. It also demonstrates ICA's performance on noisy data by adding random noise to the mixed signals. Visualizations are created using matplotlib to compare original, mixed, and recovered signals, with and without noise.
